# Measure HSI Signal with a Logic Analyzer


Small Project to configure an internal clock and then measure that clock 
via a GPIO pin. We can achieve this using the MCO which which is the 
Microcontroller Clock Ouput.


1. Select the MCO source
2. Push the MCO to A PIN (PA8)
3. Sample the PIN using a USB Logic Analyzer
